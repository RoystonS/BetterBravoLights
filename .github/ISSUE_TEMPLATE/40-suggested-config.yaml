        Use this form if you've developed some BetterBravoLights configuration that you think would be useful for others.  If we use your configuration we'll give you credit, of course!
        
        If you're submitting multiple separate pieces of configuration for separate aircraft, please submit this form once for each aircraft so that we can keep the changes and discussions separate.

        Please add your configuration here.
        It's really helpful if each configuration line is preceded with a comment explaining where that line comes from.  This helps us figure out how 'authoritative' the configuration is.

        Checking the source code of the aircraft is _really_ reliable. Checking the documentation/POH is _quite_ reliable. Other educated guesses are _fairly_ reliable.

        See https://github.com/RoystonS/BetterBravoLights/blob/f4574ea871ac09f1936b48478ef1f9be8ea13ff9/BravoLights/Config.ini#L110-L117 for examples.

        (I can't buy every possible addon aircraft and am only an amateur simulator pilot.)
