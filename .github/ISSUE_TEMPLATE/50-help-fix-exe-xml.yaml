        Use this form if you've tried to install BetterBravoLights but it refused to attempt to install because your MSFS `exe.xml` file was corrupt.

        However, rather than filling this form out by hand, BetterBravoLights v0.3.1 and above comes with a one-click option that will fill it all in for you automatically.

        I understand that BetterBravoLights didn't corrupt the file and that it's simply warning
        about the corrupted file. But could you help me fix it?
